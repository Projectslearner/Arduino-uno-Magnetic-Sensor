# Arduino Uno Magnetic Sensor (Hall Effect)

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a Hall effect sensor with an Arduino Uno to detect the presence of a magnetic field. The sensor outputs a signal when exposed to a magnetic field, which is then read by the Arduino Uno and displayed on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Hall Effect Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Hall Effect Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the Hall effect sensor to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the sensor to 5V on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the GND pin of the sensor to GND on the Arduino Uno.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the Hall effect sensor to the Arduino Uno according to the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the messages indicating the presence or absence of a magnetic field.

#### Applications

- **Proximity Sensing:** Detect the presence of magnets or magnetic objects.
- **Security Systems:** Integrate with alarm systems triggered by magnetic field changes.
- **Position Sensing:** Determine the position of objects with magnetic markers.

#### Notes

- Ensure the Hall effect sensor is positioned near the magnetic field of interest.
- Adjust the code logic or use external components based on specific project requirements.
- Use appropriate magnetic field sources to test and calibrate the sensor sensitivity.
